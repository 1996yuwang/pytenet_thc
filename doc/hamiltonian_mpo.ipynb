    "How can we construct a MPO version of a sum of operator chains? A useful mental picture are railway tracks running from east to west (i.e., from the rightmost to the leftmost lattice site), possibly interconnected by switches. Each operator chain corresponds to a train running once from east to west along one route through the tracks. (There is no risk of collision since trains operate at different hours.) Markers are placed at uniform intervals besides the tracks, each displaying a local operator (like the Pauli matrices in the example above). The operator chain (train) collects the markers which it encounters during its ride (preserving order).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can exploit the locality of typical operator chains (e.g., acting non-trivially only on two neighboring lattice sites) by creating a special \"identity\" track: its markers solely display the local identity operation. Operator trains share this identity track before and after the sites which they act on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert the operator chains to an `MPO`, we use an intermediate `OpGraph` data structure, which represents the overall track layout as a graph. We can then assemble an `MPO` from it. The number of tracks running in parallel (at a given longitude) is precisely the virtual bond dimension."

    "Let's discuss how (additive) quantum numbers enter the story so far. In many cases, a Hamiltonian respects conservation laws, like preserving the total spin or particle number of a physical system, for example. How to exploit this within the matrix product operator formalism is not entirely obvious, but here is how it works: we first identify the physical quantum numbers at each lattice site, like $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ for spin-up or spin-down. (PyTeNet stores them in variables denoted `qd`.) Likewise, each virtual bond is also associated with a quantum number (`qD` in PyTeNet). Now every MPO tensor obeys a sparsity pattern dictated by the quantum numbers: The sum of first physical and left virtual bond quantum number of each non-zero tensor entry is equal to the sum of second physical and right virtual bond quantum number. (Here \"first\" and \"second\" refers to the row and column dimension of a site-local operator.) PyTeNet provides the `is_qsparse` utility function to probe such a sparsity pattern. Note that we do not have to manually enforce it; instead, the sparsity pattern appears naturally when constructing the MPO representation of a Hamiltonian, and quantum numbers provide the means for actually recognizing and understanding it. In practical terms, quantum numbers allow to optimize common operations like singular value decompositions via partitioning into non-zero blocks.\n",

    "where $S^{\\pm}_j$ are the spin raising and lowering operators at site $j$, respectively, and $S^z_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^z_j$. As one might guess, the raising and lowering operators change the spin quantum number by $1$ (such that the overall net effect of both $S^{+}_j S^{-}_{j+1}$ and $S^{-}_j S^{+}_{j+1}$ is zero). We can translate this into code by sandwiching the virtual bond quantum number $1$ between $S^{+}_j$ and $S^{-}_{j+1}$, and likewise $-1$ between $S^{-}_j$ and $S^{+}_{j+1}$. (To avoid any numerical rounding issues, quantum numbers are generally stored as integers, and thus we multiply all spin quantum numbers by $2$ in the code.) By the same functionality as above, the quantum numbers are copied from the operator chains to the graph and finally into the virtual bond quantum numbers of the MPO, endowing MPO representation of the Hamiltonian with quantum numbers. See `hamiltonian.py` for the concrete implementation."
